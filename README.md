AndFlmsg is a combination of Fldigi and Flmsg for portable devices running Android. 

The main objective of this development is to provide a low power highly-portable, as in mobile or backpack, Flmsg/Fldigi solution. 

The inclusion of modes like MT-63, Olivia and long interleave MFSK modes allows audio coupling to be used effectively without the need for an audio interface. 

The display and entry forms can be independently modified in order to match the screen real-estate of the target devices. 

It does basically most of what the fully featured version of FLMSG does.
